# GEM_PFA_Draw_Toolkit
Toolkit for Draw plots of GEM PFA for CMS

noise_full_good_position.C is to Draw 2D plots of noise vs. 24 chambers.

noise_full_good_position_4eta.C is to draw 2D plots of noise vs. 4 eta groups.

noise_full_4eta_1D.C is to draw 1D plots of N vs. noise in 4 eta groups.

Ratio_full.C is to Draw 1D plots of N vs. chi2/ndf.

trim_full.C is to Draw 2D plots of trimDAC vs. trimRange, you could change the "maskReason" cut to draw which plots you need.

trimDAC_full_N.C is to draw 1D plots of N vs. trimDAC, which has been normalized to 1 event.

trimRange_full_N.C is to draw 1D plots of N vs. trimRange, which has been normalized to 1 event.
